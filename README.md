Bootstrap 4 offline documentation

Bootstrap 4 is new so many developers are yet to fully understand its inner workings and grid system , so most of us end up going online each time we want to check out how to do something as little as adding or styling a button. So i came up with this project to create a totally offline documentation for bootstrap 4

Please dont forget to star this project it if you find it helpful

Thank you
